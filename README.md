Cool dice game I made after learning how to play with real dice


Some basic rules of how it runs:
  1. Goal is to have the least end total possible
  2. Every roll you have to keep at least 1 die
  3. Although, you can keep as many as you want per roll
  4. You have to roll the die you don't keep
  5. A 3 is equal to a 0
  
Example:
  Say you roll 1 1 1 5 with 4 die, and you choose to keep the three 1's
  you can only reroll that 5 once as it is the last die.
  Another would be 1 5 6 4 2 2 with 6 die, you choose to keep the 1 2 2
  and reroll the 5 6 4, reroll them to get 2 5 3, keep the 2 and 3, reroll
  5 to get 4. You are now out of rerolls.
  
  So ideally you would want all 3's as that would result in a total of 0.
